I'm a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor in the USA) in the
[Department of Psychology at the University of Cyprus (UCY)](http://ucy.ac.cy/dir/en/component/comprofiler/userprofile/lombardo).
I direct the Laboratory for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (LAND) and
am a faculty member of the
[Center for Applied Neuroscience (CAN) at UCY](http://www.cancyprus.org).
My interests and expertise span multiple disciplines (psychology, neuroscience,
genomics, data science, machine learning, computational biology, bioinformatics,
neuroendocrinology) and are all applied in a translational research program
focused on understanding heterogeneity and early developmental mechanisms
involved in autism and atypical neurodevelopment.   

I did my undergraduate degree in
[psychology at the University of California, Davis](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu)
and shortly after worked as a postgraduate researcher at both the
[UC Davis MIND Institute](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/) and
[UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain](http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu). I then
moved to the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk) and obtained my
PhD in the [Department of Psychiatry](http://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk) at the
[Autism Research Centre](https://www.autismresearchcentre.com) with
[Prof Simon Baron-Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Baron-Cohen).
I continued in Cambridge after the PhD, with post-doctoral fellowship funding
from [Jesus College, Cambridge](https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk) and the
[British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk).

Research interests:  autism, neurodevelopmental disorders, data science,
heterogeneity, individual differences, computational psychiatry,
precision medicine, fetal programming, social and affective neuroscience,
social communication, social cognition, emotion, mentalizing, theory of mind,
empathy, sex/gender, brain development, steroid hormones, genomics,
transcriptomics, network science, bioinformatics.

Prospective students, PhD applicants, and post-docs interested in working with
me should contact me directly. I'm looking for driven independent thinking
individuals with a good level of experience and/or grasp of the field of autism
research.  Expertise in other fields like social and affective neuroscience,
neuroimaging methods, genomics, systems biology, bioinformatics are also a plus.  
Advanced computational skills (e.g., coding skills in R, Python, and/or MATLAB,
advanced statistical background, machine learning, data science) are also
highly valued and essential.
